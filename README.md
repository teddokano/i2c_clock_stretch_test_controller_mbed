# Test code for I²C target device emulator with variable clock stretching setting

## What is this?
This is controller side test code for [I²C target device emulator with variable clock stretching setting](https://github.com/teddokano/clock_stretching_on_lpcxpresso55s36_i2c_polling_b2b_slave).  
The code runs on [FRDM-K64F](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/FRDM-K64F/).  
I²C signals are on [I2C_SDA (= PTE25) and I2C_SCL (= PTE24) pins](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/FRDM-K64F/#board-pinout). 

## Environment for build
